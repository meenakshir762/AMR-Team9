# AMR-Team9
In this problem we analyze the sentiment of the specific stock.We created an Analytical Server "OHLC" (Open/High/Low/Close) time series based on the ‘Stock List’ dataset provided to us.OHLC is an open-high-low-close chart is a type of chart typically used to illustrate movements in the price of a financial instrument over time.

We have used the python libraries matplotlib (for visualizing the various charts), Tkinter for creating the UI, pandas for creating dataframe.

Tkinter is used to develop GUI applications. It supports a variety of widgets as well as a variety of widgets methods or universal widget methods.we  modified our SeaofBTCapp class, we  populate this tuple with all of the possible pages to our application. This will load all of these pages for us. Within our _init_ method, we're calling StartPage to show first, but later we can call upon show_frame to raise any other frame/window that we please.StartPage class provide some navigation to other pages from the StartPage.we've added buttons that use controller.show_frame, passing PageOne and PageTwo through as parameters.
We may provide the start date and end date along with symbol using which we plot OHLC.
